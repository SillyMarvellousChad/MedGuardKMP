# MedGuard AI

**MedGuard AI** is a Kotlin Multiplatform application designed to improve medication safety by identifying potentially dangerous drug interactions using a **reliable rule-based engine**, enhanced with **optional AI explanations**.

The project focuses on **safety-first design**, accessibility, and graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable — making it suitable for real world healthcare scenarios and educational use.



##Project Goals

- Prevent dangerous medication combinations
- Provide clear, human-readable risk explanations
- Remain functional without external AI services
- Demonstrate clean Kotlin Multiplatform architecture
- Prioritize accessibility and usability for all users


## Key Features

- 🧠 **Rule-based medication risk engine** (offline & deterministic)
- 🤖 **Optional AI explanations** with graceful fallback
- 📊 **Visual risk graph** (Low / Moderate / High)
- ♿ **Accessibility Mode** (large text across the UI)
- 📷 **Medicine scan flow** (camera-ready, demo simulated)
- 🛡️ Safe handling of network, quota, and API failures
- 🧱 Clean separation of UI, domain logic, and risk evaluation


## Kotlin Multiplatform Architecture

This is a **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** project targeting **Android and iOS**.
